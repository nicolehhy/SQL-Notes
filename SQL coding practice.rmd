## Q1 : Find out the students choosing Course1 has greater grade than the ones who choose Course2.

Tip: Find out the students choosing Course1 or Course2 first;
     Using join with the main table with 'where' to filter the result on 'greater grade' condition;
     < We can compare the grade during the 'join' process >
```SQL
SELECT a.s_num, a.stu_name
FROM
(SELECT s_num,stu_name 
FROM Student)a

INNER JOIN
(SELECT s_num,grade 
FROM Course
WHERE course=1)b
ON a.s_num=b.s_num

INNER JOIN
(SELECT s_num,grade 
FROM Course
WHERE course=2)c
ON b.s_num=c.s_num

WHERE b.grade>c.grade
```
Tip : We need to find out cd_name having both A and B comodity;
      We use 'Join' to join them so they can be rows with same cd_name and compared with each other
      Use the 'Where' filter outside these two subqueries
```SQL
SELECT a.cd_name,a.poi,b.poi
FROM
(SELECT cd_name, poi FROM as_poi 
		where lo_country_code= 'CN' 
		and lo_city_code ='NJG'
		and cmdty='CDFG')a 
INNER JOIN (SELECT cd_name, poi FROM as_poi 
		where lo_country_code= 'CN' 
		and lo_city_code ='NJG'
		and cmdty='CDFG')b ON a.cd_name=b.cd_name
WHERE a.poi > b.poi
```

### Q2 : Find out the anchors who are level 2 but have higher socre than the ones with level 1

Tip : We just need to find out the anchors whose scores are larger than the minimum socre of level 1 anchors;
      So here we can use 'where' clause, because we can set score < specific number.
```SQL
SELECT cd_name, poi FROM as_poi 
		where lo_country_code= 'CN' 
		and lo_city_code ='NJG'
		and cmdty='CDFG'
		and poi < (select min(poi) FROM as_poi 
		where lo_country_code= 'CN' 
		and lo_city_code ='NJG'
		and cmdty='K') 
```

Q3 : Find out the students who have average score larger than 60

Tip : Find out the student_id whose avg scores are larger than 60 first;
      Then using 'INNER JOIN' to get the student_name from S table.

```SQL
select s.s_name,s.s_no,c.avg(grade)
from S s
inner join
(select s_no,avg(grade) from C c group by s_no having avg(grade) > 60 ) ON s.s_no=c.s_no
```

Q4 : Find out the students who failed all the courses

Tip : Find out the student_id who has at least one course with 60 or more
      Then using 'NOT IN' in that range to get the student_name from S table.

```SQL
SELECT stu_name
FROM student
WHERE stu_num NOT IN ( SELECT stu_num FROM course where grade > 60)
```
