## Q1 : Find out the students choosing Course1 has greater grade than the ones who choose Course2.

Tip: Find out the students choosing Course1 or Course2 first;
     Using join with the main table with 'where' to filter the result on 'greater grade' condition;
     < We can compare the grade during the 'join' process >
```SQL
SELECT a.s_num, a.stu_name
FROM
(SELECT s_num,stu_name 
FROM Student)a

INNER JOIN
(SELECT s_num,grade 
FROM Course
WHERE course=1)b
ON a.s_num=b.s_num

INNER JOIN
(SELECT s_num,grade 
FROM Course
WHERE course=2)c
ON b.s_num=c.s_num

WHERE b.grade>c.grade
```
