## Q1 :Diffrence between DELELTE and TRUNCATE
Delete: Delete is used to delete a row in a table;
   you can rollback after the delete statement;
   It is a Data Munipulation Language;
   
Truncate: Truncate is used to delete all the rows from a table;
          you can't roll back data;
          It is a DDL command; It is faster;
          
## Q2 : Different subsets of SQL ?
DDL: This consists of the commands that can be used to define the database schema.
     CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, COMMENT, RENAME
    
DML: This consists of the commands that can deal with the manipulation of data in the database.
     SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CALL, EXPLAIN PLAN, LOCK TABLE
     
DCL: This includes commands which deal with the rights, permissions and other controls of the database.
     GRANT, REVOKE
     
TCL: This deals with the transaction of database.
     commit、rollback，savepoint， set transcation
     
## Q3 What do you mean by DBMS? What are its different types?
It is a software application that interacts with user, applications and the database itself to capture and analyze the data.
And the data stored in the database can be modified, retrieved and deleted, can can be any type like strings, numbers and ETC.

Hirerarchial: it had the style of processor, and the successive type of relationship. So it has a structure similiar to that of
a tree while in the nodes represent the records and the branches of the tree represent the fileds.

Relationship: it use a structure that allows the users to identify and access data in a ralation to another piece of data in 
the database.

Network: it supports to many to many relations where in multiple member record can be linked

Objected: and the object oriented databases management system use a small individual software called objects and each object contains 
a piece of data and intructions for the actions to be done for the data.

## Q4 What do you mean by table and field ?
Table refers to the collection of data in an organised manner in form of rows and columns. 
A field refers to the number of columns in a table. 

## Q5 What are joins in SQL ?
Join refers to combine data from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. It is used to merge two tables or 
retrieve data from there. There are four joins in SQL
Inner Join : 
Left Join :
Right Join ：
Full Join :

## Q6 What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR2 datatype in SQL ?
Both of them can be used for character datatype. VARCHAR2 can be used for strings of variable length while CHAR can be used 
for strings of fixed length. For example, char(10) can only store 10 characters and will not be able to store a string of any 
other length whereas varchar2(10) can store any length i.e 6,8,2 in this variable.

## Q7 What is a Primary key ?
A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
Null values not allowed.

## Q8 What are Constraints ?
Constraints are used to specify the limit on the data type of the table. 
It can be specified while creating or altering the table statement. The sample of constraints are:

-NOT NULL
-CHECK
-DEFAULT
-UNIQUE
-PRIMARY KEY
-FOREIGN KEY

## Q9  What is the difference between SQL and MySQL ?
SQL is a santdard language that stands for structured query language based on the English Language, it is the core of relational database
which is used for accessing and mangeing database wheras MySQL is a relational database management system, such like SQL SERVER.

## Q10 What is a Unique key ?

Unique key identified a single row in a table.
Multiple value are allowed oer table.
Null value allowed.

## Q11 What is a Foreign key ?
Foreign key maintains the referential integrity by enforcing a link between the data in two tables.
Foreign key in the child table references the primary key in the parent table.
The foreign key constraint prevents actions that would destroy links between the child and parent tables.

## Q12 What do you mean by data integrity ?  
Data Integrity defines the accuracy as well as the consistency of the data stored in a database. 
It also defines integrity constraints to enforce business rules on the data when it is entered into an application or a database.

## Q13 What is the difference between clustered and non clustered index in SQL ?
The differences between the clustered and non clustered index in SQL are :

Clustered index is used for easy retrieval of data from the database and its faster whereas reading from non clustered index 
is relatively slower.
Clustered index alters the way records are stored in a database as it sorts out rows by the column which is set to be 
clustered index whereas in a non clustered index, it does not alter the way it was stored but it creates a separate object 
within a table which points back to the original table rows after searching.One table can only have one clustered index 
whereas it can have many non clustered index

## Q14 What do you mean by Denormalization ?
Denormalization refers to a technique which is used to access data from higher to lower forms of a database. It helps 
the database managers to increase the performance of the entire infrastructure as it introduces redundancy into a table. 
It adds the redundant data into a table by incorporating database queries that combine data from various tables into 
a single table.

## Q15 What are Entities and Relationships ?
Entities:  A person, place, or thing in the real world about which data can be stored in a database. Tables store data 
that represents one type of entity. For example – A bank database has a customer table to store customer information. 
Customer table stores this information as a set of attributes (columns within the table) for each customer.

Relationships: Relation or links between entities that have something to do with each other. For example – The customer name 
is related to the customer account number and contact information, which might be in the same table. There can also be 
relationships between separate tables (for example, customer to accounts).

## Q16 What is an Index ?
An index refers to a performance tuning method of allowing faster retrieval of records from the table. An index creates an 
entry for each value and hence it will be faster to retrieve data.

## Q17 Explain different types of index.
Unique Index:

This index does not allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed. If a primary key is defined, 
a unique index can be applied automatically.

Clustered Index:

This index reorders the physical order of the table and searches based on the basis of key values. Each table can only have 
one clustered index.

Non-Clustered Index:

Non-Clustered Index does not alter the physical order of the table and maintains a logical order of the data. Each table can 
have many nonclustered indexes.

## Q18 What is Normalization and what are the advantages of it ?
Normalization is the process of organizing data to avoid duplication and redundancy. Some of the advantages are:

Better Database organization
More Tables with smaller rows
Efficient data access
Greater Flexibility for Queries
Quickly find the information
Easier to implement Security
Allows easy modification
Reduction of redundant and duplicate data
More Compact Database
Ensure Consistent data after modification
